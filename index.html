    <section class="rules">
      <h2>📋 Game Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>🎧 Each player selects their top 10 favorite entries before the Grand Final.</li>
        <li>🔢 You'll then rank them from 1st to 10th place.</li>
        <li>🏆 After the Grand Final, your score is calculated based on how your picks performed in the real contest!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>📈 Scoring System:</h3>
      <p>Your ranked picks are multiplied by the following values based on position:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Rank</th><th>Multiplier</th></tr>
        <tr><td>1st 🥇</td><td>x12</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2nd 🥈</td><td>x10</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3rd 🥉</td><td>x8</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4th</td><td>x7</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5th</td><td>x6</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6th</td><td>x5</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7th</td><td>x4</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8th</td><td>x3</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9th</td><td>x2</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10th</td><td>x1</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>✨ The better your top picks perform in the real show, the more points you'll earn!</p>
